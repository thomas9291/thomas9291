### JUBIN THOMAS
 
 Without work, I spent this year 2022 and 2023 studying programming, in order to change my professional career to be able to make my passion (programming), my job.

I currently have a web developer certificate, done through the udemy website and another react developer certificate, also done online with udemy.
Actually I am doing a full stack developer bootcamp with spiced academy in berlin.

 I am looking for a collaboration with an international company that works with the react program in order to perform my learning, and to become a react web developer.

I am looking for a team that allows me to improve and develop myself.

If you have any questions, I would be happy to answer them.
